# array of integers(both +ve and -ve) find the two elements such that their sum is closest to given number x.

=begin
IDEA:
  - We check if there is any pair matching the sum in the array first, if there is, return it.
  - Sort the array
  - Find smallest sum and greatest sum and check if the given sum is in range:
    + If it's out of range rightward (greater than our greatest sum) => the greatest sum
    + If it's out of range leftward (smaller than our smallest sum) => the smallest sum
    + If it's in range, init left ptr <- 0, right ptr <- end index, min_diff <- âˆž:
      (abolished) 1st while loop moving the right pointer until it is equal to the left pointer, push the smallest diff in array[2].  
      (abolished) 2nd while loop moving the left pointer until it is equal to the right pointer, push the smallest diff in array[2].
      - Return array[:1]
      => incorrect approach
      Correct approach:
      1. find their diff, min_diff = |diff| if |diff| < min_diff
      2. if their diff < 0, it tells you that the current sum < the given sum, and we need something closer,
      so we can only choose to increment the left pointer to point to a greater number
      3. if their diff > 0, it tells you that the current sum > the given sum, equivalenly we can only choose
      to decrement the right pointer to point a smaller number, so our sum matches closer to the given sum
      4. repeat 1 -> 3 until the left pointer = right pointer
